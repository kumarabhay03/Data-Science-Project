# SQL Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to the **SQL Data Analytics Project**, a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts tailored for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. This repository is designed to assist **data analysts, business intelligence (BI) professionals, and data enthusiasts** in effectively querying and analyzing relational databases.

Each SQL script in this collection is structured around a specific analytical theme, demonstrating best practices for writing efficient and scalable queries. Whether you're looking to **explore database structures, generate key performance metrics, analyze time-based trends, perform segmentation, or conduct cumulative analysis**, this repository provides ready-to-use SQL scripts to streamline your workflow.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
This project aims to:
- Provide **pre-written, well-structured SQL queries** for common data analysis scenarios.
- Facilitate **quick insights** from relational databases using optimized queries.
- Cover **various analytical domains**, such as time-based trends, segmentation, and cumulative metrics.
- Promote **best practices** in SQL query writing for performance and readability.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is structured into different categories of SQL scripts to help users find relevant queries easily:

### 1️⃣ **Database Exploration**
- Listing all tables, columns, and data types
- Checking missing values and duplicate records
- Understanding database relationships and foreign keys

### 2️⃣ **Measures & Metrics**
- Aggregating key business metrics (e.g., total revenue, average order value, customer count)
- Computing ratios and percentage-based KPIs

### 3️⃣ **Time-Based Analytics**
- Daily, weekly, and monthly trend analysis
- Rolling averages and moving windows for trend detection
- Year-over-year (YoY) and quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) comparisons

### 4️⃣ **Cumulative Analytics**
- Running totals and cumulative sums
- Lifetime value (LTV) analysis
- Churn rate and retention tracking

### 5️⃣ **Segmentation & Cohort Analysis**
- Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis
- Cohort retention and performance tracking

### 6️⃣ **Advanced SQL Techniques**
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex queries
- Window functions for ranking and running totals
- Recursive queries for hierarchical data
