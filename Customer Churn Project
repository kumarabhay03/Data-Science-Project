# Customer Churn Analysis – Neo Telecom

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer churn is a critical problem for telecom companies. As a data scientist at **Neo Telecom**, the goal of this project is to analyze customer data, gain insights into churn patterns, and build predictive models to reduce customer attrition.  

This project involves **data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning models** (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to analyze and predict customer churn.

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset used in this project is **customer_churn.csv**, which contains customer details, contract information, payment methods, and churn status.  

### 🔹 Data Dictionary  
The dataset includes columns such as:  
- **CustomerID** – Unique identifier for customers  
- **Gender** – Male or Female  
- **SeniorCitizen** – Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **Tenure** – Duration of the customer's stay (in months)  
- **InternetService** – Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, or No)  
- **Contract** – Customer’s contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two years)  
- **PaymentMethod** – Method used for payment (Electronic check, Mailed check, etc.)  
- **MonthlyCharges** – Customer’s monthly bill  
- **Churn** – Whether the customer has churned (Yes or No)

## 🚀 Tasks Performed  

### 1️⃣ Data Manipulation  
✔ Extracted specific columns from the dataset  
✔ Filtered data based on customer attributes  
✔ Selected a random sample of 333 records  
✔ Counted unique values in the **Churn** column  

---

### 2️⃣ Data Visualization  
📊 **Bar Plot** – Distribution of Internet Services  
📊 **Histogram** – Distribution of Customer Tenure  
📊 **Scatter Plot** – Relationship between **Tenure** and **Monthly Charges**  
📊 **Box Plot** – Comparison of **Tenure** across Contract Types  

---

### 3️⃣ Linear Regression  
📈 **Objective:** Predict **MonthlyCharges** based on **Tenure**  
✔ Split data (70% train, 30% test)  
✔ Built a **Simple Linear Regression Model**  
✔ Calculated **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**  

---

### 4️⃣ Logistic Regression  
📈 **Objective:** Predict customer churn  
✔ **Simple Logistic Regression** using **MonthlyCharges**  
✔ **Multiple Logistic Regression** using **Tenure** & **MonthlyCharges**  
✔ Evaluated performance using **Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Score**  

---

### 5️⃣ Decision Tree  
📈 **Objective:** Classify whether a customer will churn based on **Tenure**  
✔ Split dataset (80% train, 20% test)  
✔ Built a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
✔ Evaluated model using **Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Score**  

---

### 6️⃣ Random Forest  
📈 **Objective:** Improve churn prediction using multiple decision trees  
✔ Built a **Random Forest Classifier** with **Tenure & MonthlyCharges**  
✔ Split dataset (70% train, 30% test)  
✔ Evaluated model using **Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Score**

## 📢 Results & Insights  
🔹 Senior male citizens using **electronic check payments** have a higher churn rate.  
🔹 Customers with **tenure > 70 months** or **monthly charges > $100** are more likely to churn.  
🔹 Customers with **two-year contracts** and **mailed check payments** churn less frequently.  
🔹 **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy in churn prediction.  

---

## 💡 Future Improvements  
🔹 Implement **Hyperparameter Tuning** for better model performance.  
🔹 Explore **Deep Learning models** for churn prediction.  
🔹 Deploy the model as a **web application** for real-time churn prediction.
