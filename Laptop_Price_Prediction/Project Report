1. Problem Statement:
Predicting the price of laptops based on their features is a critical aspect for both manufacturers and consumers. 
This project aims to bridge the gap between laptop specifications and their market prices, enabling better purchasing and pricing decisions.  

2. Project Objective:
To build predictive models that estimate laptop prices based on various specifications, such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage,
and other key attributes.  


3. Data Description:
The dataset consists of the following features:  
-Categorical Features: Brand, Processor Type, Operating System, GPU, etc.  
- Numerical Features: RAM (GB), Storage (GB), Screen Size (inches), Battery Life (hours), etc.  
-Target Variable: Laptop Price  


4. Data Preprocessing Steps:
- Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values for key attributes.  
- Encoding Categorical Variables: Used **Label Encoding** to convert non-numerical data into numerical form.  
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Used **Grid Search CV** for optimizing parameters of the Random Forest Regression model.  
- Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.  



5. Choosing the Algorithm for the Project:
1. Linear Regression: To model the linear relationship between laptop price and its features.  
2. Random Forest Regression: To capture non-linear relationships and interactions among features.  

6. Motivation and Reasons for Choosing the Algorithm:
- Linear Regression: Offers a simple, interpretable baseline for continuous data.  
- Random Forest Regression: Handles non-linear relationships effectively and is robust against overfitting.  



7. Model Evaluation and Techniques:
1. Linear Regression Model:  
  - Achieved **74.44% accuracy** on the test data.  
  - Relatively lower accuracy due to its inability to capture non-linear relationships. 
  - Have More MAE, MSE and RMSE score.
2.Random Forest Regression Model:  
  - Achieved **74.44% accuracy** with superior predictive performance.  
  - Model evaluation metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R²).  
  - Have less MAE, MSE and RMSE score.

8. Key Insights:
 Important Features Influencing Price
1. Processor Type: Higher-end processors (e.g., Intel i7, i9) significantly increase laptop prices.  
2. RAM: Laptops with higher RAM (16 GB or more) tend to cost more.  
3. Brand: Premium brands (e.g., Apple, Dell XPS) command higher prices.  
4. Storage Type: SSDs contribute more to the price compared to HDDs.  
5. GPU: Gaming laptops with dedicated GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce) are priced higher.  

Trends Observed
- Lightweight laptops with long battery life are generally more expensive.  
- Laptops with larger screen sizes (15.6 inches and above) tend to have higher prices due to added features like 4K resolution.  

Actionable Insights
- Brands targeting budget-conscious consumers should focus on mid-range specifications like 8 GB RAM and mid-tier processors.  
- Marketing efforts can highlight specific features like SSDs and GPUs to justify premium pricing.  


9. Future Possibilities of the Project:
- Incorporate additional data, such as warranty period and customer reviews, to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Explore advanced models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting for enhanced performance.  
- Develop a user-friendly web application to allow consumers to input specifications and get price predictions in real time.  


10. Conclusion:
The Laptop Price Prediction project successfully identified key factors influencing laptop prices. The **Random Forest Regression
model** demonstrated better predictive power compared to Linear Regression, achieving an accuracy of **74.44%**.
The insights derived from this project can assist manufacturers and retailers in pricing strategies and help customers make
informed purchasing decisions.
